# ai-skillweave

> Weaving skills, MCP, and configs across every AI agent harness — `ollama launch claude`, `openclaw`, `pi`, `codex` — on any machine.

One-command setup for all your Ollama agent harnesses: proper MCP servers, web tools, and harness-specific configs, all portable and reproducible.

## Built on Everything Claude Code (ECC)

> **The skills powering this repo come from [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)** — a community-maintained library of production-ready AI agent skills covering every domain of software development.

`ai-skillweave`'s core contribution is **cross-harness delivery**: ECC was originally designed for Claude Code only. This repo extends it so the same skill library loads natively into every `ollama launch` agent — OpenClaw, Pi, Codex, and Claude Code — each in the format that harness expects.

## Before You Begin — First-Time Setup

Run these steps **once** on a new machine before cloning this repo.

### 1. Install Ollama

```bash
# macOS — download the app (recommended) or use brew:
brew install ollama
# or: download from https://ollama.com and open /Applications/Ollama.app
```

After installing, Ollama runs as a menubar app. Make sure it's running before launching any harness.

### 2. Pull a model (or use cloud models)

```bash
# Cloud model — no download needed, streams from Ollama's servers:
ollama pull qwen3.5:397b-cloud    # or minimax-m2.7:cloud

# Local model — runs on your machine (~2GB download):
ollama pull llama3.2:3b           # fast, good for subagents
```

### 3. Install Node.js (for MCP servers)

```bash
brew install node
# Verify: node --version  (needs v18+)
```

### 4. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Authenticate (requires Claude Pro/Max/Team account):
claude auth login
# → opens browser, log in with your Anthropic account

# Verify it works:
claude --version
```

### 5. Install OpenClaw, Pi, Codex (optional — install only what you use)

```bash
# OpenClaw — first run downloads and configures it:
ollama launch openclaw --config
# → follow the onboarding wizard, then quit

# Pi — first run installs it:
ollama launch pi
# → let it initialize, then Ctrl+C once it's ready

# Codex CLI:
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

> **Note:** OpenClaw, Pi, and Codex are optional. `install.sh` will skip harnesses that aren't installed and show a warning.

### 6. Install Python 3 (usually pre-installed on macOS)

```bash
# Check: python3 --version  (needs 3.8+)
# If missing: brew install python3
```

## MCP Servers (Claude Code)

### Automatically applied by `./install.sh` (no API keys needed)

`scripts/setup-mcp.sh` reads `configs/claude-mcp-servers.json` and merges these into `~/.claude.json`:

| Server | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `memory` | Persistent memory across Claude Code sessions |
| `sequential-thinking` | Chain-of-thought reasoning tool |
| `context7` | Live docs lookup for any library/framework |
| `playwright` | Browser automation from within Claude Code |
| `google-docs-editor` | Read/write Google Docs (local server, pre-built) |
| `token-optimizer` | 95%+ context reduction via deduplication — saves Opus tokens |

**No tokens or API keys needed for any of the above.** `install.sh` applies them automatically on a new machine.

### Manually added (require API keys)

The `_api_key_servers_commented` block in `configs/claude-mcp-servers.json` contains templates that are **never auto-applied** — you fill them in and add them yourself:

```bash
# GitHub (needs a PAT from github.com/settings/tokens)
claude mcp add github \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_YOUR_TOKEN \
  --scope user \
  -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# Exa web search (needs key from exa.ai)
claude mcp add exa \
  -e EXA_API_KEY=exa_xxx \
  --scope user \
  -- npx -y exa-mcp-server
```

To add a server from the template: copy it from `_api_key_servers_commented` → move it to `mcpServers` → fill in the real key → run `scripts/setup-mcp.sh --force`.

---

## OpenClaw Subagents

OpenClaw's native subagent system works via `~/.openclaw/subagents/`. After setup:

- Web tools (`ollama_web_search`, `ollama_web_fetch`) are enabled via the Ollama plugin
- Gateway runs on `localhost:18789`
- Skills are loaded from `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` (ECC skills copied there)

## ECC Skills — Everything Claude Code

This repo is built on top of **[Everything Claude Code (ECC)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)** — a community-maintained library of production-ready skills covering every domain of software development: testing, architecture, security, cloud deployment, language-specific patterns, and more.

### What ECC Is

ECC skills are structured Markdown prompts (`.md` files) that tell AI agents *how to think* about specific tasks. Each skill covers: when to activate, how to approach the problem, examples, and pitfalls. They're harness-agnostic by design.

### Skill Counts (verified)

| Source | Skills | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ECC core | 183 SKILL.md dirs | 185 total dirs, 2 are local-only (learned + project-guidelines-example) |
| Anthropic official | 64 | In `anthropic-official/skills/` subdir (excludes README/docs) |
| OpenAI Codex | **469** (all loaded) | In `openai-codex/skills/`; previously capped at 100, now uncapped |
| Community curated | 0 (catalog only) | Web-based skill index, no downloadable files |
| Personal learned | varies | Your own patterns extracted from sessions |
| **Claude Code cache total** | **~775 files → 1.16MB** | Combined into `combined-skills.txt` |

### What ai-skillweave Adds

ECC was originally built for Claude Code. **ai-skillweave extends it across every `ollama launch` harness:**

| Harness | Skills | How they load |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| `ollama launch claude` | ~775 (all sources) | Injected via `--append-system-prompt-file` at startup |
| `ollama launch openclaw` | 187 (183 ECC + 3 learned + extras) | Real `.md` file copies, YAML-sanitized for compatibility |
| `ollama launch pi` | 187 (183 ECC + 3 learned + extras) | Symlinks to ECC skill dirs |
| `ollama launch codex` | 230 (183 ECC + 46 native) | Symlinks + YAML-sanitized copies; 46 are native Codex skills |

> **YAML sanitization:** ECC skills with block-scalar descriptions or extra metadata fields (`homepage`, `license`, `version`) are automatically sanitized on-the-fly for OpenClaw and Codex compatibility without modifying the source files.

### Cross-Harness Skill Sync

When you learn something useful in one session, sync it everywhere:
```bash
learn-sync          # Extract patterns + sync to all harnesses
learn-sync-dry      # Preview what would sync
```

Learned skills live in `~/.claude/skills/learned/` and are automatically propagated to all harness-native skill directories.

### Installing ECC

```bash
./safe-install.sh                  # ECC only
./safe-install.sh --with-curated   # ECC + Anthropic official + community skills
```

### Keeping ECC Up to Date

When ECC adds new skills upstream, pull and rebuild without a full re-install:

```bash
scripts/update-ecc.sh           # Pull latest + rebuild cache + re-sync all harnesses
scripts/update-ecc.sh --check   # Just check if updates are available
scripts/update-ecc.sh --force   # Force cache rebuild even if already up to date
```

## Token Efficiency — Skills Injection + Prompt Caching

All 775 skills (~1.16MB / ~289K tokens) are injected into every `claude` session via `--append-system-prompt-file`. This sounds expensive, but Claude Code's **prompt caching** makes it economical:

### How caching works

| Event | Cost at Opus pricing |
|-------|---------------------|
| Session 1 (cache miss) | ~$4.35 (289K × $15/MTok) |
| Session 2+ same day (cache hit) | ~$0.43 (289K × $1.50/MTok cache read) |
| Each conversation turn | Only new tokens in the exchange |

**5 sessions/day with caching: $4.35 + 4 × $0.43 = $6.07**  
Without caching it would be $4.35 × 5 = $21.75. With caching: **72% cheaper.**

### What's already enabled

`setup-mcp.sh` sets `tengu_system_prompt_global_cache: true` in `~/.claude.json`. This persists the cache **across sessions** (not just within one session), so the system prompt (skills injection) is reused from cache as long as the file content doesn't change.

Running `./install.sh` on a new machine configures this automatically.

### Why full injection beats selective injection

Selective/on-demand loading requires the user to know which skills to activate. Full injection means Claude automatically applies relevant skills (TDD when writing tests, security review when touching auth, etc.) **without any explicit invocation** — which is the whole point.

### `lean-skills.txt` — optional fallback

`~/.claude/skills-cache/lean-skills.txt` contains only your 3 personal learned skills (~6K tokens) as a fallback for situations where you want minimal injection. Switch via `.zshrc`:
```bash
# In _claude_with_skills function, change:
cat ~/.claude/skills-cache/combined-skills.txt   # ← full 775 skills (default)
# to:
cat ~/.claude/skills-cache/lean-skills.txt        # ← personal skills only
```

## Cloud vs Local Models

All model names ending in `-cloud` or `:cloud` are Ollama cloud-hosted (no local GPU needed, but require internet):

| Model | Type | Context | Best for |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `minimax-m2.7:cloud` | ☁️ Cloud | 1M tokens | Long context, multimodal, Claude Code / Cline |
| `qwen3.5:397b-cloud` | ☁️ Cloud | 256K | Reasoning, complex tasks, OpenClaw / Pi / Codex |
| `qwen3.5:cloud` | ☁️ Cloud | 256K | Same endpoint as 397b-cloud |
| `qwen3.5-claude:latest` | ☁️ Cloud | 256K | Claude-optimized fine-tune |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 💻 Local | 128K | Fast, ~5-10 sec, good for subagents |
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 💻 Local | 128K | Coding tasks, offline use |

```bash
# Configure for Claude Code (large context tasks):
./install.sh --model minimax-m2.7:cloud

# Configure for OpenClaw / Pi / Codex (complex reasoning):
./install.sh --model qwen3.5:397b-cloud

# Add a local fallback model (no internet needed):
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
./install.sh --model llama3.2:3b
```
