# ai-skillweave

> Weaving skills, MCP, and configs across every AI agent harness — `ollama launch claude`, `openclaw`, `pi`, `codex` — on any machine.

One-command setup for all your Ollama agent harnesses: proper MCP servers, web tools, and harness-specific configs, all portable and reproducible.

## Built on Everything Claude Code (ECC)

> **The skills powering this repo come from [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)** — a community-maintained library of production-ready AI agent skills covering every domain of software development.

`ai-skillweave`'s core contribution is **cross-harness delivery**: ECC was originally designed for Claude Code only. This repo extends it so the same skill library loads natively into every `ollama launch` agent — OpenClaw, Pi, Codex, and Claude Code — each in the format that harness expects.

If you find the skills useful, go star ⭐ [affaan-m/everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Install |
|------|---------|
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | `brew install ollama` or download app |
| Python 3 | `brew install python3` |
| Node.js | `brew install node` (for npx-based MCP servers) |
| Claude Code | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| OpenClaw | `ollama launch openclaw --config` |
| Pi | `ollama launch pi` (first run installs it) |
| Codex | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |

---

## Install Options

```bash
# Full setup (default model: qwen3.5:397b-cloud)
./install.sh

# Use a local model instead (faster, no cloud dependency)
./install.sh --model llama3.2:3b
./install.sh --model qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Configure only specific harnesses
./install.sh --only claude
./install.sh --only openclaw
./install.sh --only pi
./install.sh --only codex

# Skip ECC skills installation (faster, if skills already installed)
./install.sh --skip-skills

# Run health check
./install.sh --verify
# or: scripts/verify.sh

# Uninstall shell layer only (configs preserved)
./install.sh --uninstall
```

---

## MCP Servers (Claude Code)

These are automatically configured by `scripts/setup-mcp.sh`:

| Server | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `memory` | Persistent memory across Claude Code sessions |
| `sequential-thinking` | Chain-of-thought reasoning tool |
| `context7` | Live docs lookup for any library/framework |
| `playwright` | Browser automation from within Claude Code |
| `google-docs-editor` | Read/write Google Docs (local server, pre-built) |

### Adding API-Key-Gated Servers

1. Copy an entry from `configs/claude-mcp-servers.json` (`_api_key_servers_commented` section)
2. Move it to the `mcpServers` block
3. Fill in your API key
4. Run `scripts/setup-mcp.sh --force`

Or use the Claude Code CLI:
```bash
# GitHub
claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_xxx \
  -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# Exa web search
claude mcp add exa -e EXA_API_KEY=exa_xxx -- npx -y exa-mcp-server
```

---

## OpenClaw Subagents

OpenClaw's native subagent system works via `~/.openclaw/subagents/`. After setup:

- Web tools (`ollama_web_search`, `ollama_web_fetch`) are enabled via the Ollama plugin
- Gateway runs on `localhost:18789`
- Skills are loaded from `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` (ECC skills copied there)

## ECC Skills — Everything Claude Code

This repo is built on top of **[Everything Claude Code (ECC)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)** — a community-maintained library of production-ready skills covering every domain of software development: testing, architecture, security, cloud deployment, language-specific patterns, and more.

### What ECC Is

ECC skills are structured Markdown prompts (`.md` files) that tell AI agents *how to think* about specific tasks. Each skill covers: when to activate, how to approach the problem, examples, and pitfalls. They're harness-agnostic by design.

### Skill Counts (verified)

| Source | Skills | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ECC core | 156 SKILL.md | 157 dirs, 1 is `learned` storage |
| Anthropic official | 64 | Actual skills in `anthropic-official/skills/` subdir |
| OpenAI Codex | 470 available, 100 loaded | In `openai-codex/skills/`; capped to manage context size |
| Community curated | 0 (catalog only) | The repo is a web-based skill index, not loadable files |
| Personal learned | varies | Your own patterns extracted from sessions |
| **Claude Code cache total** | **~379 files → 1.1MB** | Combined into `combined-skills.txt` |

### What ai-skillweave Adds

ECC was originally built for Claude Code. **ai-skillweave extends it across every `ollama launch` harness:**

| Harness | Skills | How they load |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| `ollama launch claude` | 391 (all sources) | Injected via `--append-system-prompt-file` at startup |
| `ollama launch openclaw` | 159 (156 ECC + 3 learned) | Real `.md` file copies, YAML-sanitized for compatibility |
| `ollama launch pi` | 159 (156 ECC + 3 learned) | Symlinks to ECC skill dirs |
| `ollama launch codex` | 202 (156 ECC + 46 native) | Symlinks + YAML-sanitized copies; 46 are native Codex skills |

> **YAML sanitization:** 12 ECC skills with block-scalar descriptions or extra metadata fields (`homepage`, `license`, `version`) are automatically sanitized on-the-fly for OpenClaw and Codex compatibility without modifying the source.

### Cross-Harness Skill Sync

When you learn something useful in one session, sync it everywhere:
```bash
learn-sync          # Extract patterns + sync to all harnesses
learn-sync-dry      # Preview what would sync
```

Learned skills live in `~/.claude/skills/learned/` and are automatically propagated to all harness-native skill directories.

### Installing ECC

```bash
./safe-install.sh                  # ECC only
./safe-install.sh --with-curated   # ECC + Anthropic official + community skills
```

### Keeping ECC Up to Date

When ECC adds new skills upstream, pull and rebuild without a full re-install:

```bash
scripts/update-ecc.sh           # Pull latest + rebuild cache + re-sync all harnesses
scripts/update-ecc.sh --check   # Just check if updates are available
scripts/update-ecc.sh --force   # Force cache rebuild even if already up to date
```

---

## Cloud vs Local Models

All model names ending in `-cloud` or `:cloud` are Ollama cloud-hosted (no local GPU needed, but require internet):

| Model | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `qwen3.5:397b-cloud` | ☁️ Cloud | High quality, ~1-5 min responses |
| `qwen3.5:cloud` | ☁️ Cloud | Same endpoint as 397b-cloud |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 💻 Local | Fast, ~5-10 sec responses |
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 💻 Local | Good for coding, ~30 sec responses |

For subagent tasks that don't need maximum quality, use a local model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
./install.sh --model llama3.2:3b
```
